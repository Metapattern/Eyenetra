### Advance ###
##### Architecture / Identity / Experience #####

Metapattern's first spin-off company,  Advance builds and operates nomadic camps for creative exploration. Think 21st-century zen safari camp. Off-grid eco-luxury, packed into modified shipping containers and deployable anywhere on Earth to host intimate gatherings for groups to connect with themselves, each other and Nature.

We initiated and led the project including initial concept, business plan, physical architecture, furniture, experience design, operations strategy, brand identity, photography, digital renders, marketing materials and website. We executed the launch campaign for the first camp deployment and positioned Advance as a state of the art premium experience in a new market (nomadic luxury hospitality).


### A Human Right ###
##### Identity / Digital #####

Metapattern worked with [A Human Right](http://www.ahumanright.org), a globally-focused NGO dedicated to connecting the 5 Billion humans currently living without internet access, to refine their brand identity and launch an immersive storytelling experience through a redesigned website. We crafted a series of visual vignettes to bring to life the global importance of the internet, from Kenya to Afghanistan to Egypt.

With the aid of our identity and storytelling design, A Human Right's founder Kosta Grammatis (a Media Lab alumnus) was a finalist for last year's TED Prize, and the site has reached hundreds of thousands of visitors.

### Immunity Project ###
##### Identity / Digital ######

The Immunity Project is developing a revolutionary vaccine against HIV, using machine learning. They asked Metapattern to help them communicate their story with the world.

We guided the entire team through a series of design workshops, discovery and ideation sessions to identify the essence of the brand, the core values and the visual imagery needed to represent with clarity and accuracy the essence of Immunity Project's vision.

Their crowdfunding campaign successfully raised $482,000 and was backed by Y Combinator and Microsoft Research. Today they are working towards human clinical trials for 2015.
